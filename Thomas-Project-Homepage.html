                                The purpose of TutorTools is to give students access to tutoring resources in a more
                                convenient
                                and
                                user
                                friendly format.
                                Our goal is to create a website that students can use in order to find a tutor for a
                                specific
                                class
                                that
                                they need help in.
                                TutorTools gives both students and tutors an option to schedule/modify meetings, view
                                each
                                other's
                                profiles,
                                notify web designers of issues,
                                and view meeting history of previous meetings. Students are able to rate tutor sessions
                                and
                                these
